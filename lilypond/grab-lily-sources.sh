#!/bin/bash

# this script will set up everything (hopefully) that you
# need to compile LilyPonda from source - that is, it will:
# - install appropriate version of git
# - download required libraries
# - clone lilypond sources
# - clone scripts by Janek that make building easier
# - set environment variables used by various lilypond scripts.
#
# You will be asked where the lilypond sources and Janek's
# scripts should be placed.
#
# The script was written for Debian-based Linux distributions
# that use apt package manager (for example Ubuntu).

# TODO:
# add 'lily' alias/function? Or something else to make running easy
# install build-lily or add scripts to PATH?
# don't use sudo inside the script.  Instead, require that the script
# is ran with sudo.
# add options: default yes, and quiet apt-get?
# and building default lilypond.
