# this script will set up everything (hopefully) that you
# need to compile LilyPonda from source - that is, it will:
# - install appropriate version of git
# - download required libraries
# - clone lilypond sources
# - clone scripts by Janek that make building easier
# - set environment variables used by various lilypond scripts.
#
# You will be asked where the lilypond sources and Janek's
# scripts should be placed.
#
# With -y option, the script will assume that your answer
# to all questions is 'yes'.
# With -b option, lilypond will be built immediately after
# the script finishes.
#
# This script was written for Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based Linux
# distributions. It should work on other distributions that
# use apt package manager (for example Debian), but you may
# have to change 'sudo' to 'su', for example.
