helpmessage="This script will build LilyPond for you.

You should have a git repository with LilyPond source code,
and an environment variable \$LILYPOND_GIT pointing there.

Usage: with no options specified, lilypond will be built in
\$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR/current, using the current state of the
working directory from \$LILYPOND_GIT repository.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
OPTIONS

-c <commit> tells the script to compile a particular commit
   instead of current working directory state. This can be
   a SHA1 commit ID, branch name or a tag name. This value
   will also be used as the name of the build subdirectory,
   unless overridden with a -d option.

-d <path> is the directory where the build will happen.
   This can be an absolute path or a path relative to
   \$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR.

-s option means to \"build from scratch\", i.e. delete previous
   build results from target directory before compiling again.

-b option tells make just to compile C++ files, without walking
   through all other files.  If you don't need other files to be
   compiled, use this option to make building faster.

-h displays this help.

-m <branches> will combine multiple branches of LilyPond source
   code before building.  This can be handy when you'd like to
   have a LilyPond version that combines several experimental
   (not yet released) features.  Also, it will probably be more
   convenient than trying to do the merge yourself.

-j <value> sets the number of processor threads used for building.
   By default the script uses all available threads, but if this
   causes your computer to slow down too much, you can override
   that decision using this option.
   <value> should be the number of threads you want to use plus one.

-t <value> sets the amount of time for which the script is paused
   when the user has to check whether the setup is correct.

-r compile regression tests.

-l build in the current working directory.

-f <path> take sources from this directory, not \$LILYPOND_GIT.

-w don't use colors in output, only black&White.

Sometimes it is useful to have multiple LilyPond builds,
or to be able to continue changing source code while the
previous state is being compiled.  You can do this quite
easily - set your \$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR to a directory outside
of \$LILYPOND_GIT, and compile lilypond in its subdirectories
(using the -d option of this script).

In such situations (i.e. when the build directory isn't inside
\$LILYPOND_GIT) the script will clone lilypond repository into
that build directory, so that it will be completely separate
from your main repository.  This way you can continue your work,
switch branches etc. without affecting the code that is being
compiled at the moment.

Note that these \"satellite build repositories\" work similarly
to \"regular builds\" inside \$LILYPOND_GIT - you don't have to
commit your work to build it, and if you make changes, you can
rebuild them in the same satellite repo without having to copy
things around or rebuilding from scratch.  The script handles
all this quite fine.

This script can be called from any directory whatsoever (you don't
have to be inside \$LILYPOND_GIT or \$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR).


EXAMPLES

$scriptpath
will compile current state of the working directory from
\$LILYPOND_GIT inside \$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR/current

$scriptpath -c master
will compile \"master\" branch from \$LILYPOND_GIT repository
(regardless of which branch is currently checked out there)
inside \$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR/master

$scriptpath -c release/2.16.2-1 -d stable
will compile the commit tagged \"release/2.16.2-1\" inside
\$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR/stable

$scriptpath -c master -m \"mybranch origin/dev/something\"
will compile \"master\" branch merged with local branch
\"mybranch\" and remote branch \"origin/dev/something\",
inside \$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR/master+mybranch+dev/something.
